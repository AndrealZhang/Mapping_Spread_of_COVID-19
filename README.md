# Background

As COVID-19 rapidly spreads across the US, it is essential to visualize the available data to better understand the overall toll of the pandemic on US counties. It is important to ask: How can data visualizations help county and state leadership or business owners in the US, and what other data might be needed to better understand the impact of COVID-19? 

# Data
Looking at data from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports), [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv), and [US County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/geojson-counties-fips.json), we can create an animated choropleth map that represents the number of confirmed cases per 1,000 residents in US counties.
